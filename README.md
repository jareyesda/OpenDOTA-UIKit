# OpenDOTA-UIKit
This is a simple app showcasing the use of intergrating a WebAPI to an app.

The DOTA 2 Hero Directory is an app that uses the OpenDota public API to build a directory of all characters in the popular videogame DOTA 2. The app is composed of a table view populated with icons and text gathered from OpenDota web API, and a detail view presented when a cell is tapped. The detail view shows the statistics of the character selected, as well as the option to open a guide to said character via WebKit. Currently, this app does not store any of the JSON data from the API, aside from caching images. New features are added to this app with the purpose of implementing new techniques that are learned. In the current scope, the user interface will be re-written in SwiftUI.
